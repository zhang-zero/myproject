    This class defines a Switch (node/bridge) that can send and receive messages
    to converge on a final, loop-free spanning tree. This class
    is a child class of the StpSwitch class. To remain within the spirit of
    the project, the only inherited members or functions a student is permitted
    to use are:

    switchID: int
        the ID number of this switch object)
    links: list
        the list of switch IDs connected to this switch object)
    send_message(msg: Message)
        Sends a Message object to another switch)

    Students should use the send_message function to implement the algorithm.
    Do NOT use the self.topology.send_message function. A non-distributed (centralized)
    algorithm will not receive credit. Do NOT use global variables.

    Student code should NOT access the following members, otherwise they may violate
    the spirit of the project:

    topolink: Topology
        a link to the greater Topology structure used for message passing
    self.topology: Topology
        a link to the greater Topology structure used for message passing
